Pokercpp, by Kenneth Wu
Texas hold'em style poker, asks user for amount of money to play with, then enter any key
then will start a game of poker with two other AI players.
Start of each game everyone pays a buy in fee.
Then two cards are dealt to each player, and initial round of betting starts. Raise, call, or fold. 
Raise raises the amount you want to bet in so others need to either call(match) your price or fold.
Then three cards are revealed for the flop. Then round of betting
Then one more card is revealed for the turn. Then round of betting
Then one more card is revealed for the river. Then round of betting.
Final showdown, everyone who hasn't folded revels their cards, and highest combo wins the pot.
